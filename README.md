# UniModeling

## Introduction
UniModeling is a big data analytics tool for the unified modeling and reasoning in outdoor and indoor spaces.

UniModeling supports constructing unified graph models of outdoor and indoor spaces and RFID deployments in these spaces.

It enables probabilistic incorporation of RFID data that facilitates the tracking of moving objects and enables the search for them to be optimized.

Furthermore, UniModeling is empowered with three reasoning applications that pertain to the positioning of RFID readers in outdoor and indoor spaces and the points of potential traffic (over)load in these spaces.
